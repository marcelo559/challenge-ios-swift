Hello, I'm starting to study the Swift iOS programming language through Dr. Angela Yu's "The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course.

I will share my study codes in this folder because I'll including challenges to improve my skills. If you'd like, feel free to share any comments on best practices, improvements, or sugagestions - I'd be very happy to receive your feedback.  I storage on branch called "Original" and the improvements on main branch. Enjoy!

# Egg Timer App
## Inicial App Goal 
This module will be a mix of tutorials and challenges. Most importantly, we want you to get comfortable with looking up how to do something you've never done before. In certain places of this module, you’ll need to follow the 5 step process you learnt in the Xylophone module and use Google search, StackOverflow and Apple Documentation to make your code do what you want it to. But there are also other parts where we’ll take you step-by-step through new Swift programming concepts.

### My first challenge
As a user, I want to listen a alarm sounds indicated to egg was done.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] When timer is over alarm sound plays.
