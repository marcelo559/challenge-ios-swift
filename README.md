# Challeges of iOS & Swift
This repository contains the initial and evolutionary source code that I am developing in the course "The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

For now, I coded focused on class and include a challenge. The first project was to roll dice when you press the button, I improved the code including a label that show what die won the round. Now, after I watched the Auto Layout and Responsive UIs I will fix the code to create the desired portrait and landscape layout.
