## My Goal

The goal of this project is to develop most of the topics I learned from the beginner classes in the course "The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp", by Angela Yu and the "Complete iOS 11 Swift 4 Development Course - Create 20 Apps" by Eirc Alves Brito.

## What I created

I created an application to help people who are organizing parties plan food and drinks. In this first challenge, I used the Design Pattern (MVC), worked with visual elements, and used two screens. The first captures information such as the number of adults and children (using a Text Field) and the duration of the party (I used a Slider).
The calculation is done and the result is presented on a second screen, which allows the user to recalculate if necessary.

## What I explored

- [x] Create and setup a new iOS project from scratch
- [x] Design an app in Xcode using iOS components
- [x] Incorporate my own image assets into my app
- [x] Design and build a custom app icon
- [x] Design my own UI using Figma's layout
- [x] Change UI elements programmatically
- [x] Detect user interaction and respond to it (Time field changes as soon as user interacts with slider)
- [x] Align and pin elements
- [x] Use Swift variables and arrays to store data
- [x] SEGUES for two-screen interaction
- [x] Explore Swift frameworks
- [x] Explore design patterns and use the Model View Controller pattern
- [x] Explore Swift frameworks and functions that can have outputs
- [x] Implement MVC
