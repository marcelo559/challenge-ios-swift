Hello, I'm starting to study the Swift iOS programming language through Dr. Angela Yu's "The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course.

I will share my study codes in this folder because I'll including challenges to improve my skills. If you'd like, feel free to share any comments on best practices, improvements, or suggestions - I'd be very happy to receive your feedback. Let's go!

# Dicce App
## Inicial App Goal 
The objective is watch the tutorial to introduce the core programming concepts and learn the foundation of most of the apps. I learned a lot of important programming knowledge, while building this neat dice app.

The app have two dice that react with interaction "roll" button. When you click the button the app random numbers between 1 and 6 and change the dice, each die have differente variables to controll what image show it. The "default" code, that I wrote while watched tutorials videos I storage on branch called "Original" and the improvements on main branch. Enjoy!

### My first challenge
As a user, I want to know what die win the round to rapidly identify the winner.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- In the begging both of dice need to show the lower face value;
- When “Roll” button is click the user get to know what die won;
- If made draw, the user get to know that igual result and don´t have winner.
- If made draw, encourage the user to roll again;
