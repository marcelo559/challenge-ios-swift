## My Goal

The objective of this project is developer the most of topic that I learned with beginner classes the course "The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. She introduced the core programming concepts that are the foundation of most of the apps.

## What I will create

I’m going to make a trivia quiz app, to interact with Disney lovers that staying in attraction line to spend time with subjects that they loves. With multiple choice question apps people can prove your knowledge about the most magical place in the world.
