# Curious D

## My Goal

The objective of this project is developer the most of topic that I learned with beginner classes the course "The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. She introduced the core programming concepts that are the foundation of most of the apps.

## What I will create

I’m going to make a trivia quiz app, to interact with Disney lovers that staying in attraction line to spend time with subjects that they loves. With multiple choice question apps people can prove your knowledge about the most magical place in the world.

## What I will explore

Thirt Step:

For improve my learn more about swift code and understand if I could use another way to developed questions randomly, I used AI to talk and discuss what can I did it.

    At first, I wrote a prompt to Claude.AI asked to create and comment a basic architecture for a simple trivia. Claude.AI suggestion was a little different by Angela's structure, at I was based me.
    
    After analise and undestand what it suggestion, I gave it my QuizBrain file and I asked suggestion and tips to improve it, after that I fixed my code. The main suggestion was split the nextQuestion function in 4, creating:
    
    - func resetQuiz - reset the quiz to star over
    - func getRemainingQuestion - get the number of remaining questions
    - func getTotalQuestions - get the total number of question
    - func nextQuestion - get random questions only
    
    It was great share my project with Claude.AI because he suggestion improvements for a app, like: 

    - Add a dedicated Results screen instead of just an alert
    - Create a proper data service layer to fetch questions from an API
    - Add animations and better visual feedback
    - Implement different categories of questions
    - Add a timer for each question
    
    Let´s move on to the next challenge (step)!

Second Step:

I developed and practiced based on the following items: Auto Layout, Outlet, Action, Arrays to store trivia questions, functions, structures, and MVC concepts.

Now, I have explored the Range Operator and Randomization to display questions randomly.

Previously, the form displayed the questions in the order it was created in the QuizBrain file. With this new feature, Disney fans now answer random questions—much more fun!
